          <p>Tonight’s the last get-together before spring break. One friend is flying in from Wisconsin, and four others are coming over for a late-night meal and smoke session. Since we’ll all be heading off to different places for a week, I want to make something special while also clearing out my fridge. The plan: rice bowls using whatever ingredients I have—like asparagus, bell peppers, onions, chicken, eggs, and leftover braised shoyu chicken from yesterday. To top it off, I’ll attempt an onsen tamago because it looks cool, and I saw it on YouTube Shorts last night.</p>

          <p>My only concern? This meal might be on the heavier side. A fresh, crunchy salad would be the perfect contrast. I saw Andy Cooks make a Niçoise salad, but honestly, it looked terrible. Unfortunately, asparagus is the only green I have. Hmm…</p>

          <p>I recently picked up a 4.5-inch Wüsthof utility knife, and it was worth every penny. Along with that, I invested in a salad spinner, a microplane, and a juicer. The knife is perfect for smaller tasks—slicing vegetables, trimming steaks, and chopping fruit. I made these upgrades because I literally sliced my hand open trying to cut a pear without a proper knife. Definitely my fault. :(</p>

          <p>Finding propane was a nightmare—I drove around Georgia for two hours with no luck. Last-minute pivot: I grabbed four beautifully marbled strip steaks and a pork shoulder from Publix GreenWise. I salted the steaks, marinated the pork in honey and garlic, and let them chill in the fridge for a couple of hours. When my friends arrived, we fired up the camping grill and De Buyer pan, grilling meat on foil for hours. OMG, the steak was so tender. We cooked it with garlic herb butter I had in the fridge, and it was *chef’s kiss*. I wasn’t expecting good steak from Publix or Kroger, so this was a pleasant surprise. We ate it with ssamjang, pickled radishes, garlic spinach, red lettuce, and rice. The chicken turned out solid—slightly too acidic, so I’ll go lighter on the vinegar next time.</p>

          <p>Exhausting but rewarding. Hosting a group is always stressful, but prepping food ahead of time makes everything so much easier. Grilling and eating meat fresh off the heat hits different compared to being served a plate. I’ll perfect the honey pork next time—it definitely needs to be marinated longer. And next time, I’ll actually follow the instructions for onsen eggs…</p>

          <p>I really need to take better pictures of the cooking process, but here’s what I got for now. See you next time!</p>
