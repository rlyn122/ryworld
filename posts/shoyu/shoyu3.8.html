        <h2>Hello world! This is my inaugural post.</h2>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I have a friend flying in from Wisconsin today and a couple friends coming over for a late night 10 pm meal and smoke. A total of 5 people are coming over. After today, we are all going on spring break to our various locations, so this is a final get together for a week. I want to treat them to something nice while getting rid of stuff in my fridge that will go bad soon. So today I plan to make rice bowls working with whatever is in my fridge. Asparagus, bell peppers, onions, chicken, eggs, rice, braised shoyu chicken (prepped yesterday). I plan on doing a nice onsen tamago on top cuz it looks cool and I saw it on yt shorts yesterday.</p>
          
          <p>My only concern is that it will be kind of a heavy meal. It would be nice to have something to eat along with this, something like a bright salad that is crunchy.  I was watching a video by Andy Cooks yesterday but tbh Nicoise Salad looks like fucking ass, but I only have asparagus as a green hmm.</p>

          <p>I went out and purchased a nice 4.5 inch utility wustoff and it was well worth it. I also invested in things like a salad spinner, microplane, and a juicer. Its the perfect size for smaller tasks: cutting vegetables, trimming steaks and chops, etc. I did all this because i sliced my hand open because i didnt have a smaller knife to use while cutting a pear. Also my fault uwu :(.</p>
          
          <p>Anyways, I went out to multiple different stores to buy propane for like two hours because nowhere in Georgia sells it apparentlyâ€¦ So last day pivot, I picked up 4 really nice looking strip steaks and 1 pork shoulder (i think thats what they were) from publix greenwise that actually looked they had good marbling. I salted the steaks, covered the pork in honey and garlic, and set them in the fridge for two hours. Later when the friends came over, we busted out the steaks, took out the camping grill, and the de buyer pan, and grilled meat on foil for a couple hours. OMG the steak was so tender and delicious we cooked it with garlic and herb butter that I had in the fridge and it was super delish. I haven't actually had good steak from publix or kroger yet, so this was such a nice surprise. We ate it with ssamjang, pickled radishes, garlic spinach, red lettuce, and rice. The chicken was super solid, definitely a little bit acidic, so I need to be light on the vinegar next time. The pan got seasoned for real, this time, and change colors entirely. Honestly this knife is really nice, I can't wait to build out the collection more!</p>
          
          <p>Honestly it was a super exhausting day, but good nonetheless. Hosting alot of people is always stressful, but having food prepped the day before or the morning before is honestly very time and stress savings. I definetly would do this again, its just nice to grill meat and eat it hot is such a different experience than being served it. I will get the honey pork right next time! It just needs to be soaked/marinated in it before hand imo...Also i will actually follow the directions for onsen egg next time :(</p>
